# ChessGameManagement

## Explanation:
At the end of this project it should be possible for every chess player to store and manage your chess scoresheet in your own account. 

Furthermore, it should be possible to display every move on a chess board and to analyze the individual moves. 

If you are part of a team, your own games and the team games will be displayed separately to create a better overview.
